            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>About a year ago I was forced to start teaching computer science to students of an agricultural college. At that time, I did not have a sufficient knowledge base, but I was a confident PC user. While preparing for the classes, I independently mastered the basics of programming and realized that I like it.</p>
            <p>I set myself the goal of mastering programming to a professional level and getting a remote job in the field of WEB development. I consider myself capable of learning. Over the past year, I have successfully completed several courses, but I consider it necessary to constantly study.</p>
            <p>My disadvantage is poor knowledge of English. I am working to eliminate this shortcoming.</p>
